# Merkle-Bucket-Tree
In our project, we implement Merkle Bucket Tree by using hashing and its hash table data structure. We implemented our project with two hashing functions such as k mod n, mid square, or folding. Various big organizations such as Dropbox, Bit torrent and Cassandra (anti-entropy repair tool) use MBT for data verification. With the help of MBT, a file is broken down into smaller chunks and each chuck, gets transferred separately which ultimately helps to avoid data-tampering, deduplication and data prevent data corruption. We will be elaborating it in our project.
The output of our program consists of Merkle Bucket Tree, showing individual buckets, and showing individual node digests. The cardinality for our MBT is 8. User can import n number of documented file and the merkle bucket tree would be created using string fold and SHA-256 hashing algorithm. In addition to MBT implementation, we added two more features in our program, one is in which user can compare two files by inputting their path location and the second is that user can also compare two fully generated Merkle Bucket Tree. In this project, our output will be saved in a .txt file and can be used for later purpose.  We have created six different classes of java and they all perform unique functionality.
